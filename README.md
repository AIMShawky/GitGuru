# GitGuru

## ðŸš€ Features

- Reads a predefined list of Git commit hashes.
- Resets the working directory using `git reset --hard`.
- Pulls the latest changes with `git pull`.
- Cherry-picks each revision one by one:
  - If a conflict occurs, the cherry-pick is aborted and the commit is added to an error list.
  - If successful, the changes are immediately pushed using `git push`.
- At the end, a summary is printed showing successful and failed cherry-picks.
